# React Page Layouts

This project demonstrates the practice of extracting layout components into a layouts folder.  For examples I've used code from:

* [Form Layout] by Ahmad Shadeed, for a CSS grid HTML form
* [Grid by Example] by Rachel Andrew, for a number of Grid layouts.
* [Original Modal component] by Luke Whitehouse, for a React modal which I refactored from classes to hooks: [here](https://github.com/neohed/react-modal-component) 

Bugs:
* Clicking the area outside of the modal doesn't close it.
